# GBVSR Frame Meter Mod Update

A simple way to download and extract [Agersant's Frame Meter Mod](https://github.com/agersant/gbvsr-frame-meter) ~~if you're on windows~~.

All you need to do is run the executable on the game directory.

You can also rename the game to anything and make this executable the `GBVSR.exe` so it runs when you open the game through steam.
